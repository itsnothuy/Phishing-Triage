# ✅ Phishing Triage Setup Complete!

Your phishing triage system is now configured and ready to use with your API keys.

## 🔑 Configured Services

### ✅ Active Services
- **URLhaus**: `4274b7f56a37b66877ec691b742b262f255d2594f6bd21a7` ✅ Working
- **VirusTotal**: `cdb68ea3fe7c564809caf3aa6d6db6f79ef119a1f4f16223d8fb84355901700c` ✅ Working

### ❌ Optional Services (Not Configured)
- **PhishTank**: Service discontinued
- **ANY.RUN**: Optional paid service
- **Joe Sandbox**: Optional paid service  
- **Cuckoo Sandbox**: Self-hosted option

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Activate Environment
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Start the System
```bash
python3 start.py
```
Select option 1 to start the API server.

### 3. Test the API
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Submit a URL for analysis
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "http://suspicious-site.com/login"}'

# Get report (replace {id} with actual submission ID)
curl http://localhost:8000/report/{id}
```

## 📖 Documentation

- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs (when server is running)
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
- **Metrics**: http://localhost:8000/metrics

## 🔧 Current Capabilities

### ✅ Working Features
- ✅ **URLhaus Intelligence**: Real-time malicious URL detection
- ✅ **VirusTotal Intelligence**: Multi-engine scanning (4 requests/minute)
- ✅ **URL Feature Analysis**: 35+ sophisticated URL features
- ✅ **Report Generation**: Comprehensive markdown reports
- ✅ **REST API**: Full FastAPI with auto-documentation
- ✅ **Multi-source Intel**: Combines multiple threat feeds

### ⚠️ ML Model Status
The machine learning model requires scikit-learn which had installation issues with Python 3.13. The system currently runs in "intelligence-only" mode using:
- URLhaus threat intelligence
- VirusTotal scanning
- Basic rule-based analysis

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Add Machine Learning (Recommended)
Try installing scikit-learn with conda:
```bash
# Install conda/miniconda if needed
conda create -n phish-triage python=3.11
conda activate phish-triage
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy
pip install fastapi uvicorn httpx pydantic jinja2
python -m ml.train  # Train the model
```

### Option 2: Use Current Setup (Intelligence Only)
The system works great with just threat intelligence:
- URLhaus provides known malicious URLs
- VirusTotal gives multi-engine verdicts
- Combined intelligence gives good coverage

### Option 3: Add More Services
- Get ANY.RUN API key for sandbox analysis
- Set up Cuckoo Sandbox for free local analysis
- Add custom threat feeds

## 📊 Testing Your Setup

### Test Basic Intelligence
```bash
python3 -c "
import config
from enrich.urlhaus import lookup_url
from enrich.free_intel import multi_intel_lookup

# Test URLhaus
print('URLhaus:', lookup_url('http://example.com'))

# Test multi-intel
print('Multi-intel:', multi_intel_lookup('http://example.com'))
"
```

### Test API Submission
```bash
# Start server in background
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 &

# Submit test URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "http://test-phishing.com/login"}'
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ API keys are properly configured in `.env`
- ✅ Virtual environment is active
- ✅ All threat intel APIs are working
- ⚠️ Free tier rate limits apply (respect them)
- ⚠️ Keep your API keys secure

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "ModuleNotFoundError"
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate  # Activate virtual environment
```

### "API key not found"
```bash
cat .env  # Check if keys are in the file
python3 config.py  # Test configuration loading
```

### "scikit-learn won't install"
```bash
# Use conda or try older Python version
conda create -n phish-triage python=3.11
```

### Rate limit errors
- Expected with free tiers
- System continues with available data
- Upgrade to paid tiers for higher limits

## 📈 Performance Expectations

With your current setup:
- **URLhaus**: Instant results for known malicious URLs
- **VirusTotal**: ~2-5 second response time (free tier)
- **API Response**: < 1 second for intelligence-only analysis
- **Rate Limits**: 4 VirusTotal requests/minute

## 🎉 Congratulations!

Your phishing triage system is ready to help detect malicious URLs using real threat intelligence. Even without the ML model, you have:

1. **Professional API** with auto-documentation
2. **Real threat intelligence** from URLhaus & VirusTotal  
3. **Comprehensive reports** with IOCs and recommendations
4. **Scalable architecture** ready for additional services

Start protecting against phishing attacks! 🛡️
