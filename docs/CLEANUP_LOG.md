# Project Cleanup Log

This document details the files and directories that were removed from the Phishing Triage project to optimize storage, reduce repository size, and ensure only necessary files are deployed. This cleanup was performed after local development was completed.

---

## Removed Files and Directories

The following items were deleted from the `phish-triage/` directory. For deployment, only essential application code and static assets are required.

### 1. Machine Learning Development Artifacts

*   **`mlruns/`**: This directory contained all `MLflow` experiment tracking data (runs, parameters, metrics, artifacts like plots). While vital during model development, it is not needed for the live application's inference process. The final `model.joblib` contains the necessary model artifact.
*   **`ml/models/`**: This directory is part of the MLflow model registry, storing different versions of the `phish-triage-classifier` model. Similar to `mlruns/`, these are development-time artifacts.
*   **`ml/model_card.md`**: A generated Markdown file providing documentation about the trained model. Its content can be regenerated or extracted if needed, but it's not essential for runtime.

### 2. Python Virtual Environment

*   **`.venv/`**: This directory contained the local Python virtual environment and all its installed packages. It is specific to the development machine and operating system. For deployment, Docker builds a fresh environment based on `requirements.txt`, making `.venv/` unnecessary for the deployed application. It was removed to free up local disk space and keep the repository clean.

### 3. Backend Development & Testing Assets

*   **`backend/tests/`**: Contains unit and integration tests for the backend code. Tests are run during development and CI/CD pipelines, but are not shipped with the production application.
*   **`backend/temp_openai_test.py`**: A temporary Python script used for debugging and testing the OpenAI integration. Not part of the core application logic.
*   **`backend/config.py`**: This configuration file was found to be redundant. Its functionality (loading environment variables and setting default configurations) is now fully handled by `python-dotenv` and direct `os.getenv()` calls within `backend/api/main.py` and other modules.
*   **`backend_server.log`**: A log file generated during local server execution. Logs are runtime outputs and should never be committed.

### 4. Frontend Development & Build Assets

*   **`frontend/node_modules/`**: This directory contained all Node.js dependencies for the React/TypeScript frontend. It's typically very large and only necessary for local frontend development or a separate frontend build process. Since FastAPI serves the pre-built `index.html` directly, these are not needed in the deployed image.
*   **`frontend/package.json`**,
*   **`frontend/package-lock.json`**,
*   **`frontend/postcss.config.js`**,
*   **`frontend/tsconfig.json`**,
*   **`frontend/README.md`**: These files are configuration and documentation related to the React/TypeScript frontend development setup. They are not required for the deployed static HTML/CSS/JS frontend.
*   **`frontend/src/`**: This directory contained the source code for the React/TypeScript application. Since the decision was made to simplify the frontend to a single `index.html` file, this source code is no longer needed for deployment.
*   **`frontend/Dockerfile`**,
*   **`frontend/nginx.conf`**: These were likely remnants from a previous architecture where the frontend was intended to be served by a separate Docker container (e.g., using Nginx). With FastAPI now serving the `index.html` directly, these are obsolete.

### 5. General Development & Temporary Files

*   **`__pycache__/`** (all instances): These directories contain Python bytecode cache files. They are automatically generated by Python and are not part of the source code.
*   **`cursor_*.md`**: Files generated by the Cursor IDE for chat logs or temporary notes. Not part of the project itself.
*   **`README.md.external`**: A redundant or outdated README file.
*   **`model.joblib`** (in root directory): A duplicate copy of the trained model. The canonical location is `ml/model.joblib`.
*   **`logs/`**: General log directory, similar to `backend_server.log`, used for runtime logging.

## `.gitignore` Updates

To prevent these types of files from being accidentally committed in the future, the `.gitignore` file was updated to explicitly ignore:

*   `mlruns/`
*   `__pycache__/` (general entry)
*   `logs/` (general entry)
*   `backend/tests/`
*   `backend/config.py`
*   `backend/temp_openai_test.py`
*   `frontend/node_modules/`
*   `frontend/package.json`
*   `frontend/package-lock.json`
*   `frontend/postcss.config.js`
*   `frontend/tsconfig.json`
*   `frontend/src/`
*   `frontend/Dockerfile`
*   `frontend/nginx.conf`
*   `README.md.external`
*   `cursor_*.md`
*   `model.joblib` (root) and `/ml/model_card.md`
